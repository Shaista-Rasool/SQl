Using Employee table, solve the following queries (1-5). 
1. Create a replica of Employee table with all the records in it. 
CREATE TABLE copy_employee  AS SELECT * FROM hr.Employees;


2. Add a column ‘Permanent Address’ in it.  
alter table copy_employee add( permennat_address varchar(50));


3. Drop column ‘Address’ from it.  
alter table copy_employee drop  column permennat_address;


4. Add columns ‘House No’ character ,’Street No’ numeric, ’Area’ character ,’City’ character in it 
with the respective data types.
alter table copy_employee add(
house_no character (50)
, street_no numeric (20)
, city character(50),
area character (50)
);

  
5. Change the data type of ‘House No’ from character to numeric.  
alter table copy_employee modify house_no numeric;


6. Create the Data Definitions for each of the relations shown below, using SQL DDL. Assume the 
following attributes and data types:  
FACULTY:  
FacultyID (integer, primary key)  
FacultyName (25 characters)
  
create  table faculty( facultyid int primary key, facultynumber varchar(25));


COURSE:  
CourseID (8 characters, primary key)  CourseName (1 characters)  

create  table course(courseId char(8) primary key,coursename varchar(15));


CLASS: 
ClassID (8 characters)  
CourseID (8 characters foreign key)  
SectionNo (integer)  
Semester (10 characters)  

create  table class(class_Id char(8) ,course_Id char(8) ,section_no int , semester varchar(8),foreign key(course_Id) references course (course_Id));

STUDENT: 
StudentID (integer, primary key)  
StudentName (25 characters)  
FacultyID (integer foreign key)  

create table student(student_id int primary key,student_namme char(25),
faculty_id  int(25),  foreign key(faculty_id) references faculty(faculty_id));

7. How would you add an attribute, CLASS, to the STUDENT table?  
--> alter table student add class varchaer(20);

8. Write a SQL statement to rename the table department to dept (with both methods).  
-->alter table departments rename dept;
--> rename table departments to dept ; 

9. Write a SQL statement to add a column regionId to the table locations.  
--> alter table location add region_id int;

10. Write a SQL statement to change the name of the column state_province to state in locations 
table, keeping the data type and size same.
-->alter table locations rename column state_province to state ;
